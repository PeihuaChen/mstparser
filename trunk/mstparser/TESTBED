To test that changes to the code have not messed up previous results,
do the following.

Run the parser as such:

> mst_parse.sh train train-file:data/train.lab model-name:testbed/model test test-file:data/test.lab output-file:testbed/my_run.txt eval gold-file:data/test.lab

Score the results:

> mst_score.sh data/test.lab testbed/my_run.txt > testbed/my_score.txt

Then compare "gold_run.txt" to "my_run.txt" and "gold_score.txt" to
"my_score.txt" -- they should be the same. 

> cd testbed
> diff gold_run.txt my_run.txt
> diff gold_score.txt my_score.txt
