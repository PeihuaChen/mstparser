v0.2.2

- MSTParser now works with both MST and CONLL formats.  Pipes are now
  passed a parameter for which format they use, and they call upon
  Readers and Writers that know how to handle each format. CONLL is
  the default format. (JMB)

- Included an Ant build system that does some nice things, but which
can be ignored if make is preferred. Highlights of the additional
capabilities are: (1) class files are put in a location
(./output/classes) separate from the .java files; (2) you can get
javadocs (./doc/api) by running "sh build.sh javadoc"; (3) you can
make a release with "sh build.sh release" You don't need to install
anything extra ( ant.jar in in ./lib); the only additional steps
needed to use the Ant build setup is to set the JAVA_HOME and
MSTPARSER_DIR environment variables appropriately.
